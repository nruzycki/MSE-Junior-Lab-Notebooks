# MSE-Junior-Lab-Notebooks
### This is a series of notebooks we are using within our laboratory class to support programming and data analysis concepts related to the laboratory data. The first notebook is for tensile testing and there are four example files for tensile data, 2 for PC and 2 for PLA. The second notebook is for the FTIR comparison of virgin material to the 3D Printed material. The files all start with the letter Q. QV is virgin PC and the other files are for hex pattern, 30% fill 3D printed dogbones.  The third notebook is to model heat pulses in different materials as a function of time.
